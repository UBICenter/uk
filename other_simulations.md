Title: Basic Income for All: From Desirability to Feasibility ([link](https://www.compassonline.org.uk/publications/basic-income-for-all-from-desirability-to-feasibility/))

Authors: Stewart Lansley and Howard Reed

## Modelling

Two schemes for implementing UBI were modelled, a fast track and slow track route. Modelling was carried out using the Landman Economics Tax-Tranfer Model, using data from the Family Resources Survey to model direct taxes and benefits and the Living Costs and Food survey to model indirect taxes and benefits. 

## Schemes

Model 1 is a fast track route for establishing UBI to residents at a basic rate (weekly rates of £40 to children, £60 to adults, £175 to pensioners, total annual cost £28bn). Model 2 is a long-term scheme aimed at improving funding and basic income rates by building a targeted citizens' wealth fund (funded by borrowing, revenue-generating public assets and wealth taxation to the amount of £650bn, able to fund higher weekly rates, with gains mostly going to working-age adults, which increase by £20 per week). The fund is expected to be able to be usable by year 20.

## Benefit changes

For means tested benefits, basic income above £25 is counted and therefore reduces payment levels. Child benefit and the state pension are abolished and replaced with the UBI, though both at the basic level are increased in this scheme.

## Tax changes

The personal tax allowance is abolished and this portion of income is taxed at the basic rate. The next £11,850 is taxed at 15p to reduce the low-income loser count. All other income tax rates are raised by 3p. National Insurance contributions are converted to a flat tax of 12%.

##  Long-term phasing

Model 1 is intended for the short term, Model 2 for the long term. Model 2 pays slightly higher weekly rates, made possible by the dividends from the proposed citizens' wealth fund. It is proposed that Model 1 is implemented in one Parliament, and transitions to the more sustainable Model 2 by year 20.

## Treatment of children

The child benefit is removed (currently £21.05 for the eldest and £13.95 for additional children, per week), but increased with a UBI replacement of £40 per week in Model 1 and further increased to £50 per week in Model 2.

## Results

The results find that:

- Child poverty falls from 28.7% to 18.1%
- Working-age poverty falls from approx. 20% to 15.7%
- Pensioner poverty falls from approx. 15% to 11.3%
- The Gini coefficient falls from 0.377 to 0.337
- 75% of households gain and 25% lose income (7% lose more than 5% of income)
- In general, the number of losers among the poorest deciles is very small (0.8%, 3.1% for the 1st and 2nd deciles respectively), and most low deciles make large gains, while deciles 4-8 make small gains and the top decile makes slight losses.
