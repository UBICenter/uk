# Bath study 2017

Two cash transfer simulations were modelled in Martinelli (2017a; 2017b): Full Scheme 1 and Full Scheme 2.

Full scheme 1 features cash transfers at the same level as existing benefits, with a withdrawal of the majority of child, employment, and retirement benefits. The new weekely payments modelled were £67.01 per dependent child, £73.10 per working age adult, and £155.60 for pensioners. These new transfers, coupled with the elimination of most existing benefits, resulted in a revenue shortfall of £143 billion. This difference was made up by eliminating the personal allowance, abolishing the lower and upper limit for National Insurance Contributions so that the contribution is 12% of all income, and increasing income tax rate by 4% in all income bands. This scheme increased working age poverty by 7%, increased child poverty by 1%, and caused 42% of households to experience a drop in disposible income.
